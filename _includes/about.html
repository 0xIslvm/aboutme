  <h1> My Expertise </h1>
      <p>
      I am a <strong>Cybersecurity Researcher from Egypt</strong> with a passion for uncovering how threats operate beneath the surface.
      My core focus areas include <strong>malware analysis</strong>, <strong>reverse engineering</strong>, 
      <strong>digital forensics</strong>, and <strong>threat intelligence</strong>. I thrive on transforming complex technical challenges into actionable security solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spend most of my time analyzing real-world malware samples, decoding obfuscated payloads, writing detection rules 
      (<strong>YARA</strong>, <strong>Sigma</strong>), and developing tools to support <strong>DFIR</strong> and <strong>threat hunting</strong> operations.
      My toolkit includes deep hands-on experience with memory dumps, registry forensics, and behavioral analysis—backed by a growing malware portfolio built on 
      <em>Practical Malware Analysis</em> labs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the labs, I actively participate in <strong>CTFs</strong>, publish technical blog posts, and share knowledge through write-ups on 
      <strong>malware investigations</strong>, <strong>digital forensics</strong>, and <strong>SOC analysis</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently diving deeper into <strong>advanced unpacking techniques</strong>, <strong>anti-analysis evasion</strong>, and 
      <strong>Windows internals</strong>—constantly learning, building, and staying ahead of attackers.
      In cybersecurity, <em>curiosity isn't optional — it's essential</em>.
