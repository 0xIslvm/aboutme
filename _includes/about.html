  <h1> My Expertise </h1>
  <p> {{site.user_description}} </p>
   <p>
    I'm a <strong>Cyber Security Engineer and Researcher from Egypt</strong>, with a passion for digging deep into how threats work beneath the surface. 
    My focus areas include <strong>malware analysis</strong>, <strong>reverse engineering</strong>, <strong>digital forensics</strong>, and 
    <strong>threat intelligence</strong> — and I thrive on transforming technical challenges into actionable defenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spend my time analyzing real-world malware samples, decoding obfuscated payloads, writing detection rules 
    (<strong>YARA</strong>, <strong>Sigma</strong>), and building tools to support <strong>DFIR</strong> and <strong>threat hunting operations</strong>.
    My technical toolkit includes hands-on experience with memory dumps, registry artifacts, and behavioral analysis — 
    all backed by a growing malware analysis portfolio based on <em>Practical Malware Analysis</em> labs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the labs, I actively participate in <strong>CTFs</strong>, write detailed blog posts, and contribute to the cyber community 
    through writeups on <strong>malware</strong>, <strong>forensics</strong>, and <strong>SOC investigations</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently diving deeper into <strong>advanced unpacking</strong>, <strong>anti-analysis evasion</strong>, and 
    <strong>Windows internals</strong> — constantly learning, building, and staying ahead of attackers. 
    In this field, <em>curiosity isn't optional — it’s my fuel</em>.
