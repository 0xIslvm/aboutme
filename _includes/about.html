  <h1> My Expertise </h1>
  <p>
    I'm a <strong>Cybersecurity Researcher from Egypt</strong> with strong interest in <strong>malware analysis</strong>, 
    <strong>reverse engineering</strong>, <strong>digital forensics</strong>, and <strong>threat intelligence</strong>. 
    I enjoy turning technical problems into security insights and tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    I analyze malware, decode obfuscation, write detection rules (<strong>YARA</strong>, <strong>Sigma</strong>), and build tools 
    to support <strong>DFIR</strong> and threat hunting. My hands-on work covers memory dumps, registry forensics, and behavior analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently exploring <strong>advanced unpacking</strong>, <strong>anti-analysis evasion</strong>, and <strong>Windows internals</strong>.
    In this field, <em>curiosity fuels everything</em>.
