  <h1> My Expertise </h1>
  <p>
    I’m Islam Essam, a Cybersecurity Researcher from Egypt passionate about malware analysis, reverse engineering, digital forensics, and threat intelligence. I specialize in dissecting malware, decoding obfuscation, writing YARA and Sigma rules, and working across DFIR, registry forensics, memory analysis, and threat hunting. Currently, I’m diving deeper into advanced unpacking, anti-analysis evasion, and Windows internals—driven by curiosity to turn complex technical problems into clear security insights.
